# C2-Server

This repository is based off of Joe Helle's C2 course. An introduction to the course can be found here:<br>

The code in this repository may not match the code in the coursework entirely as I have and will continue to add my own functionality.
I would recommend this course to anyone with a basic understanding of Python. While it does not cover the basics, they are easily understood
with some time spent understanding what the code is doing.
